### HAN 504 | Assignment 9

## Description

In this repo, we used our previously built patient database and made it into a fake patient portal. 

* Create a new account type called "care provider". The care provider would have the same access as admin where they can view all the patient records and edit and update them. 

* Be able to update the email and username on the patient account.
